# Hyprland & Critical Softwares üñ•Ô∏èüîß
With the prerequisite base system established, we proceed to the core of this guide. This section delineates the process of installing Hyprland and configuring critical system software to ensure a robust and efficient workflow.

## Hyprland Installation üöÄ
1. **Install Hyprland:** 

    ```
    pacman -S hyprland
    ```

    **Pro Tip:üí°** If you're feeling adventurous, you can always grab the bleeding-edge version from the AUR for the latest features and fixes.

2. **Initiate Hyprland:**
    As we installed SDDM before, you can also start the session through it.

    ```
    Hyprland
    ```

3. **Upon initial launch:** A top bar will display with a warning and commands to launch Kitty and exit Hyprland.
To remove the warning ‚ö†Ô∏è:

    * Launch Kitty using the shortcut **`(SUPER + Q)`** 
    * Navigate to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` and either comment out or remove the line `autogenerated = 1`.

    Essential default keybindings:
    * **`SUPER + C`:** Kill the active window
    * **`SUPER + M`:** Quit hyprland (but why would you want to?)

To access web resources, open Kitty and execute `brave-browser` to launch the Brave browser.

## Critical System Components üõ†Ô∏è
1. **XDG Desktop Portal:** The XDG Desktop Portal is crucial for handling desktop functionalities such as file dialogs and screensharing.

    ```
    pacman -S xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
    ```

2. **Install Polkit:** Polkit manages system-wide privileges. Install the KDE version for compatibility:

    ```
    pacman -S polkit-kde-agent
    ```
    
    * To autostart Polkit, append the following to your `hyprland.conf`:

        ```
        exec-once=/usr/lib/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1
        ```

    * Note: Ensure there's no whitespace between `=` and `/`.

3. **QT Wayland Support:** Install the necessary libraries for QT applications to function correctly under Wayland:

    ```
    pacman -S qt5-wayland qt6-wayland
    ```

4. **Notification Daemon:** A notification daemon is essential for managing system notifications. Many apps may freeze without one running. [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) is a lightweight, customizable option:

    ```
    pacman -S dunst
    ```

    * To autostart dunst, append the following to your `hyprland.conf`:

        ```
        exec-once=/usr/bin/dunst
        ```

## Hyprland Session Reload üîÑ
After installing the critical software components and making the necessary configurations, restart your Hyprland session to ensure all new settings and software are properly initialized and integrated.
