# Prerequisites ðŸš€
This guide assumes understanding of Linux systems, particularly [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). The following prerequisites are essential for the seamless installation and setup of Hyprland on your system.

## Base System ðŸ’»
**Arch Linux:**  A minimal Arch Linux Installation is required. It's assumed that you're well-versed with the [Arch installation process]((https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)) and have a functional base system ready for Hyprland integration.

## Toolbox Essentials ðŸ§°
1. **AUR Helper:** An [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) s indispensable for efficient package management from the Arch User Repository. While the choice of helper is discretionary, I'm partial to [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay) for its efficiency and user-friendliness.

    ```
    pacman -S --needed git base-devel && git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay && makepkg -si # builds with makepkg
    ```

2. **Audio Stack:** Install and configure [Pipewire](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire) and [Wireplumber](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WirePlumber) for audio management. This modern audio setup will replace traditional systems like PulseAudio, providing better performance and flexibility.

    ```
    pacman -S pipewire wireplumber
    ```

3. **Nerd Fonts:** Install these Nerd Fonts for enhanced glyph support and aesthetics:
    * Cascadia Code
    * JetBrains Mono
    * Fira Code
    * Iosevka
    * Noto
    * Nerd Font Symbols

    ```
    pacman -S ttf-cascadia-code-nerd ttf-cascadia-mono-nerd ttf-fira-code ttf-fira-mono ttf-fira-sans ttf-firacode-nerd ttf-iosevka-nerd ttf-iosevkaterm-nerd ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd ttf-jetbrains-mono ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono
    ```

4. **Display Manager:** [SDDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM) is the recommended display manager due to its high compatibility with Hyprland. However, feel free to use your preferred display manager, understanding that some configuration adjustments may be necessary. 

    ```
    pacman -S sddm
    systemctl enable sddm.service
    ```

5. **Web Browser:** [Brave](https://brave.com/en-in/linux/) Brave will be used for accessing configuration resources and this guide. Install via:

    ```
    yay -S brave-bin
    ```

6. **Terminal Emulator:** [Kitty](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kitty) is the default terminal in the Hyprland configuration. If you prefer an alternative, be prepared to modify the config accordingly.

    ```
    pacman -S kitty
    ```

7. **Text/Code Editor:** Any text editor or IDE will suffice. This guide will use Visual Studio Code and nano for ease of demonstration, but feel free to use your editor of choice (vim, emacs, etc.).

    ```
    yay -S visual-studio-code-bin
    pacman -S nano
    ```

8. **tar:** The [tar](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/tar-command) command is a utility for archiving and extracting files. It will be essential for managing various archives throughout the installation process.

    ```
    pacman -S tar
    ```

## Assumed Competencies ðŸ§ 
*  **Basic Linux Command Line Knowledge:** You'll be spending some quality time in the terminal, so make sure you're comfortable with the command line.

*  **Package Management:** Understanding how to install and manage packages using pacman and an AUR helper is a must.

*  **Configuration Editing:** Ability to edit configuration files using a text editor, including understanding basic syntax and structure.

*  **Troubleshooting:** Some hiccups may occur along the way, so basic troubleshooting skills will come in handy.

## Additional Recommendations ðŸ“Œ
*  **Backup Your Data:** Ensure you have backups of any important data before embarking on this journey.

*  **Update Your System:** Keep your system up to date before starting the installation to avoid any potential conflicts.

With these prerequisites in place, you're primed to delve into the intricacies of the Simple Hyprland guide and craft a cool, tiling-based environment on your Arch Linux system.
