# My Hyprland Config

This is my hyprland config based on gaurav23b's simple hyprland config.
I just upload on github for save this config but you can copy it if you want ðŸ˜‰

# NOTE!!!!
- This is not completed yet so there may has some bug/error.
- This is made only for Arch (and based).
- Warning, this dotfiles will replace all your config!!!!
- And swww use a lot of ram, i recommend using hyprpaper if you don't want .gif wallpaper or transform effect. install hyprpaper:
```
sudo pacman -S hyprpaper
```
# Installation
1. git clone the repository to your home folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/zombieconao/My-hyprland-config.git ~/hyprland-config
```
