# edited-hyprland-config

This is my hyprland config based on gaurav23b's simple hyprland config.
I just upload on github for save this config but you can copy it if you want ðŸ˜‰

NOTE!!!!
This is not completed yet so there may has some bug/error.
Warning, this dotfiles will replace all your config!!!!.
and swww use a lot of ram, i recommend using hyprpaper if you don't want .gif wallpaper or transform effect. 
This is made only for Arch (and based).
