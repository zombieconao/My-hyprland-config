# My Hyprland Config

This is my hyprland config based on gaurav23b's simple hyprland config.
I just upload on github for save this config but you can copy it if you want ðŸ˜‰

# NOTE!!!!
- This is not completed yet so there may has some bug/error.
- This is made only for Arch (and based).
- Warning, this dotfiles will replace all your config!!!!
- And swww use a lot of ram, i recommend using hyprpaper if you don't want .gif wallpaper or transform effect.
